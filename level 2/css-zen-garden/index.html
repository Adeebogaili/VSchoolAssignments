                <h2 class="content-title">THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMEN</h2>
                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs,
                    broken CSS support,
                    and abandoned browsers.</p>
                <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                    efforts of folk like
                    the <a href="#">W3C</a>,<a href="#">WASP</a>, and the major browser creators.</p>
                <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin
                    to see with clarity.
                    Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

                <h2 class="content-title">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <a href="#">CSS</a>. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
                    inspire, and encourage participation.
                    To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
                    sheet into this very page.
                    The <a href="#">HTML</a> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <a
                        href="#">CSS</a> file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p><a href="#">CSS</a> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The
                    only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people
                    excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
                    able to create beauty from structure.
                    Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                <h2 class="content-title">PARTICIPATION</h2>
                <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <a
                        href="#">CSS</a> skills are necessary too, but the
                    example files are commented well enough that even <a href="#">CSS</a> novices can use them as
                    starting points. Please see the <a href="#">CSS</a>
                    <a href="#">Resources Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <a href="#">CSS</a>.
                </p>
                <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <a href="#">HTML</a>. This may seem
                    daunting at first if you've never worked this way before,
                    but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
                <p>Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you
                    have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your
                    <a href="#">CSS</a> file to a web server under your control. <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an
                    archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download
                    it and place it on our server.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">BENEFITS</h2>
                <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how
                    amazing <a href="#">CSS</a> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those
                    working
                    on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we

                <h2 class="content-title">REQUIREMENTS</h2>
                <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <a href="#">CSS 1 & 2</a> usage. <a href="#">CSS 3 &
                        4</a> should be limited to
                    widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                    functional, practical <a href="#">CSS</a> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of
                    the browsing public. The
                    only real requirement we have is that your <a href="#">CSS</a> validates.</p>
                <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ab aperiam repellendus nihil
                    nemo incidunt ut quisquam doloribus nobis doloremque, placeat nam laudantium harum deleniti
                    officiis.</p>
                <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <a href="#">CSS</a> by
                    now. When sticking to the guidelines you
                    should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
                    agents on the web these days
                    — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every
                    platform. Thatss okay, but do
                    test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox,
                    iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).

                <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                    material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting
                    visual themes to your work. We're well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
